    <h1>Team BA7 Project Proposal</h1>
    <h2>Problem / Data Domain</h1>
        
    <p>The Informatics Major is one of the fastest-growing and in-demand majors at the University of Washington. With a wide range of focus areas, the Informatics program offers diverse skills that are invaluable for entering the real world. However, due to the overwhelming flexibility that Informatics students have within the iSchool, students may find it challenging to choose a career path that suits their desires. Additionally, although the students are given a description of each class before they register, many key aspects that are crucial to the students' needs such as skills learned, class content, and workload are not adequately addressed. Oftentimes, students’ best source of information about a course is through word of mouth and other third-party sources such as <a href="https://www.ratemyprofessors.com/">RateMyProfessor</a>. In addition to the problem of uncertainty within course materials, prospective students of Informatics may be unsure what the degree entails and how skills learned from a specific focus area can be transferred to industry jobs. 
    </p>

    <p>Our identified problem has had previous solutions such as <a href="https://www.ratemyprofessors.com/">RateMyProfessor</a>, which focused on allowing students to rate and briefly describe their experience with a specific Professor in specific classes.  This setup unfortunately leads to  very polarizing reviews that can leave students feeling more confused than before.
Another previous solution to this problem is the <a href="https://www.washington.edu/cec/toc.html">Course Evaluation Catalog Table of Contents for UW</a>, which posts cumulative statistics for course evaluations for the vast majority of courses at the UW.  This information is helpful for understanding the general layout or difficulty of a class, but excludes personal student sentiments and class specifics.  This culminates in prospective students still only having the brief course description to use as a basis for what the course’s content will be.
    </p>

    <h2>App Description</h1>
    <p>Our app will take a data collection approach by giving INFO students the ability to upload their final projects for each INFO class. For example, a student would be able to upload a link to their interactive web app for INFO 340 to our app. Our app’s client-side interface will revolve around filtering different final projects for each INFO class in the iSchool. We intend to display final projects on our app in the form of cards with tags to make searching and filtering projects easier. Our app will implement a profile feature, allowing users to make profiles in order to save their search preferences and manage their uploads to the app. Our app is intended to be used by UW students currently in the iSchool and prospective applicants to the iSchool.</p>
    <p>The solution will lower the gap between the expectation and the actual work of the course, especially the students who have not taken Informatics class. Also, current Informatics major students can also expect the specifics of the course. It will help students to decide whether the course is aligned with their interests and even prepare themselves before taking the class. Plus, it is efficient when one plans to use the platform as a portfolio tractor.</p>
    <p>From the instructor point of view, one can easily share the output from the previous quarter. Here, instructors lower the burden of manually going through the student’s project after the quarter to find good examples. Additionally, the recruiters can use the platform to find prospective students by looking through the project. This can motivate students to set higher goal throughout the quarter. </p>
