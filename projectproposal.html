    <h1>Problem / Data Domain</h1>
        <p>
            The Informatics Major is one of the fastest-growing and in-demand majors at the University of Washington. With a wide range of focus areas, the Informatics program offers diverse skills that are invaluable for entering the real world. However, due to the overwhelming flexibility that Informatics students have within the iSchool, students may find it challenging to choose a career path that suits their desires. Additionally, although the students are given a description of each class before they register, many key aspects that are crucial to the students' needs such as skills learned, class content, and workload are not adequately addressed. Oftentimes, students’ best source of information about a course is through word of mouth and other third-party sources such as RateMyProfessor. In addition to the problem of uncertainty within course materials, prospective students of Informatics may be unsure what the degree entails and how skills learned from a specific focus area can be transferred to industry jobs.

        <p>The solution will lower the gap between the expectation and the actual work of the course, especially the students who have not taken Informatics class. Also, current Informatics major students can also expect the specifics of the course. It will help students to decide whether the course is aligned with their interests and even prepare themselves before taking the class. Plus, it is efficient when one plans to use the platform as a portfolio tractor.</p>
        <p>From the instructor point of view, one can easily share the output from the previous quarter. Here, instructors lower the burden of manually going through the student’s project after the quarter to find good examples. Additionally, the recruiters can use the platform to find prospective students by looking through the project. This can motivate students to set higher goal throughout the quarter. </p>
